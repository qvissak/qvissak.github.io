      <p>As you probably already figured out, my name is Quinn Vissak.</p>
      <p>I'm looking for a software developer role in mid 2018 that allows me to exhibit leadership simaltaneously with teamwork in a passionate community. My time at Macy's made me realize that people are my number one motivator to get out of bed each day. Intelligence, genuine empathy and grit are just a few characteristics I aspire every employee to have at my future place of employment. Complimentary food and a gorgeous office are certainly bonuses but not a replacement for lively bodies in the office. However, I'll indulge in the fact that location is very important to me because of family and friends. Either way the cake is sliced, something a Meyer Briggs test never told me was I am a people person.
      </p>
      <p>Now is your chance to learn more <a href="html/about.html">about</a> my personal interests.
        In a rush? Check out some <a href="html/projects.html">projects</a> that give you insight on the various tech stacks on which I'm experienced.
        I've worked in several different industries - from business, marketing, energy, to retail - giving me a wide range of <a href="html/experience.html">experience</a>.
        If tech stacks don't provide enough information, I've listed some computer languages and <a href="html/skills.html">skills</a> to give you a better idea of my compentency.
